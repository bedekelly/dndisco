# DnDisco 🐉🕺🎲

Simple networked soundboard for DMs playing games online, or anyone else.

Roadmap: 

- [x] Upload and play sounds w/ drag-n-drop (DnD!)
- [x] Clients hear what host hears
- [x] Unused files are cleaned up
- [x] Host sees when all clients are synchronised  
- [x] Hosts and clients see a sound visualisation
- [ ] Playback progress of longer-running files is synced
- [ ] Hosts create unique rooms for clients to join
- [ ] Create a decent abstraction layer for websockets
- [ ] Speed up sync notifications
